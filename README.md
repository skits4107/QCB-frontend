# Quantum Cheese Burger
A web app designed to make decision making easier for the user. The User will be able to enter a question such as "Should I go out for a burger or stay home for dinner?" and provide options such as "burger" and 
"stay home." Then using a Quantum Random Number Generator the app will select which choice they should make. This repo is the frontend, the backend (in a private repo) will handle user authentication, user data, 
and communicating to the QRNG API. 

Under the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics everytime a Quantum measurement is made each possible observation is realized in their own respective "universes" or "timelines". It in effect states that 
Instead of the wave function collapsing, the universe instead gets put into a giant state superposition where each of the different possible states are the different "universes". So contrary to popular belief, 
It has nothing to do with conscious choice as that is not a measurement of a quantum system. 

However this means by using random numbers generated by quantum measurements to make choices, you will indeed split the universe where you take different actions. Of course MWI may very well be false, but for the 
The sake of this app is fun to consider.

Users will be able to track each choice made by the app in an interactive branching timeline graphic.
